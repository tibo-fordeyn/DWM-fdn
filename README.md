## About
**My configuration files. Trying to get as close to a "what a computer should be" setup as possible.**
**Put this on GitHub for myself to clone when on a new system, and as a backup. Maybe some inspiration could be taken from this, mainly the way I did the theming.**

I use Artix Runit Linux, and started with a base DWM install. I use ST and dmenu application launcher. 

I wrote a script that, mainly just by using wal and some patches, gives you a menu to pick a color, and it completely changes every aspect of your systems color, instantly! Within the same runtime. 
    I'm using the same technique for executing standard commands like emptying your Vim cache and opening some files. 

There's a lot of other functionality in the scripts that might also be helpful. The jonaburg/picom configuration really makes it look smooth.
